        <h1>Serving Firms</h1>
        <p>A camp classic and the most outlandish
            of the Dietrich/von Sternberg pictures.
            Helen Faraday (Marlene Dietrich), a nighclub-cabaret
            singer, was also a loving mother and wife who prostituted
            herself to a nightclub owner and wealthy playboy
            Nick Townsend (Cary Grant) in order to pay for her
            scientist husband Edward's (Herbert Marshall) expensive
            ($1,500) medical bills, so that he can go for cancer
            treatment in Germany. Her husband was an American chemist
            dying of radium poisoning. Helen (taking the named Helen Jones)
            began a glamorous career as a cabaret singer on the German stage.
            She was billed as the "Blonde Venus." The film's highlight was her
            bizarre, gorilla-suited "Hot Voodoo" number, to the beat of an African
            drum, in which she first took off her gorilla head and suit to reveal h
            erself. She then sang the throaty song wearing a blonde Afro wig,
            while surrounded by archetypal 'black' dancers.

            Forced to surrender
