        <h1>Serving Firms</h1>
        <p>A camp classic and the most outlandish
            of the Dietrich/von Sternberg pictures.
            Helen Faraday (Marlene Dietrich), a nighclub-cabaret
            singer, was also a loving mother and wife who prostituted
            herself to a nightclub owner and wealthy playboy
            Nick Townsend (Cary Grant) in order to pay for her
            scientist husband Edward's (Herbert Marshall) expensive
            ($1,500) medical bills, so that he can go for cancer
            treatment in Germany. Her husband was an American chemist
            dying of radium poisoning. Helen (taking the named Helen Jones)
            began a glamorous career as a cabaret singer on the German stage.
            She was billed as the "Blonde Venus." The film's highlight was her
            bizarre, gorilla-suited "Hot Voodoo" number, to the beat of an African
            drum, in which she first took off her gorilla head and suit to reveal h
            erself. She then sang the throaty song wearing a blonde Afro wig,
            while surrounded by archetypal 'black' dancers.

            Forced to surrender
            Johnny to authorities, she eventually became an impoverished and

            her estranged husband realized that her sacrifice was for his cure,

            As the Hays Code

            her liaison with Townsend and filed for divorce and custody of
            their five year-old son Johnny (Dickie Moore).
